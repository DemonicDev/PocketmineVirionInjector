In The Process of Injecting, the plugin(s) will be copied to output, then after, the VirionInjector will Inject all virions, which are in the virions folder, into the plugin.

The great Pros of this Programm is, that you can Inject Multiple Virions at the same time, and that you can also inject virions into multiple plugins at the same time.
